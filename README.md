# Voyager

In a bid to make traveling experiences easy and less of a hassle, I present "The Voyager". 

A demo app that aims to show how tourism in countries and regions can incorporate the use of the internet to make your relaxation cravings a reality.
You can book reservations in hotels all around the world, as well as trips via various means of transport, and have a virtual glance at a vacation site you wish to visit next. 

One singular goal, taking off from you, one worry at a time
